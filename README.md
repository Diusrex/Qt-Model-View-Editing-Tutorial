Qt TableModel Implementation
============================

This repository is for my tutorial on how Model/View programming. It shows how to create a TableModel that is based around organizing data in rows.

The code currently only allows the default editing provited by QTableView. Will create a branch, or different repository, with editing later.

Requirements to Run
============================

A working installation of Qt 5.

c++11 (or could remove the unique_ptr and replace it with a normal pointer).
